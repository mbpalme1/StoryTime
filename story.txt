A man in Raefeld needed some Brot. 
But was stuck at home with his Lederhose in a knot.   
He longed for a Bratwurst, sizzling and hot.
However, he couldn't take his BMW as he had a DUI suspension.
So, passed the Schloss Eltz to the Ratskeller he trot. 
He passed up Apfelkuchen, for that was not his intention.
His friend passed by in his father's own Porsche
His friend was always so wettbewerbsfaehig, of course.
He headed towards the Biergarten, craving another cold one with no remorse.
But wisdom outraced him, so he opted for a more classic Doener of course
He dreamed of driving the Autobahn in a Porsche - the engine his therapy, speed his recourse.
